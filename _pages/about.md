# 👋 Hi!

My name is Hanjun Du, and I am a senior year undergraduate student in Automation at SJTU, advised by [Prof. Yun Gu](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/en/po_facultyv/531.html). I am also fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) and [Prof. Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/) as a research intern at UCLA.

My primary research interest lies in the intersection of vision, language, and machine learning. Particularly, I have worked on medical image segmentation, 3D reconstruction and registration. During my research internship at UCLA, I worked on online reinforcement learning pipelines and vision-language-action models.

My long-term goal is to build intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act effectively in complex real world environments.

# 🔎 Current Research Topics

- Embodied AI & Reinforcement Learning: Online RL Pipelines, Vision-Language-Action Models, Embodied Manipulation
- Medical Imaging & Surgical Intelligence: Image segmentation, 3D Reconstruction, Deformable Registration
